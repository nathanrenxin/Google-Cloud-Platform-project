These days, cloud computing is part of any IT company, be it giants like Google, Facebook, Spotify and even start-ups.Two of the main benefits of the cloud is that it is managed and you can request resources on demand. As such many companies prefer to invest all their resources on their specific software products and not on maintaining the infrastructure for the product. 

It is thus important to get contact and understand the different technologies behind cloud infrastructure. This project, part of the ID2210 - Distributed Computing, Peer-to-Peer and GRIDS, focuses on components of the Google Cloud Platform(GCP) such as compute, storage and network. We examined these components, deployed the necessary architecture and benchmarked their performance.

The projected is done with GCP Java APIs.
